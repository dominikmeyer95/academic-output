        "* Thus, retail investors put price pressure on the call side of option markets\n",

        "\n",
        "* In meme stocks, delta hedging does not work anymore, because the typical negative correlation of the assets in the hedging portfolio (options and the underlying stock) has turned. When a stock price goes up, its implied volatility typically goes down as if a stock is going up, in theory it’s because investors have more certainty about its future cashflows and profits. Meme stocks flip this around: The equity may shoot up in price, but it’s reasonable to expect that this price increase is highly unstable, thus the implied volatility stays elevated. Investment banks hence hedge a short call buy a long call positionas this hedges the volatility risk as well.\n",

        "**Ideas:**\n",
        "* Have a look at implied volatility and its variation\n",
        "* Have a look at the volatility skew as it might be less skewed based on that information\n",
        "* (Have a look at the delta Skew, which indicates the demand for downside versus upside potential in options)"
